# **_Eldoria Text Adventure_**

Eldoria Text Adventure is an interactive and mythical journey where the player takes on the role of an adventurer exploring the enchanting realms of Eldoria. This text-based game combines storytelling, puzzle-solving, and decision-making.

Upon entering their name and selecting a difficulty level, players are transported to a crossroads, initiating the game with an element of player choice. Here, they must decide between three distinct paths: Forest, Town, and Desert, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities.

Opting for the Forest Path involves solving the wise old tree's riddle, while exploring the bustling town introduces encounters with shops, mysterious merchants, and engaging puzzles. Navigating the scorching desert presents decisions impacting the character's health and word puzzles to solve.

Players can track their progress with marked completed paths and a visible health score, aiming to achieve the highest possible score. The game concludes with the final score recorded on the leaderboard, providing a competitive element for players to compare their achievements.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to easily navigate through the game, understanding where I am and the available options at any given point.
- As a user, I want puzzle-solving elements to be intuitive and enjoyable.
- As a user, I want immediate feedback on my choices and actions in the game.
- As a user, I want to track my progress in the game and see how my choices impact the overall storyline.
- As a user, I want the game's story to be presented in an engaging and immersive way.
- As a user, I want the ability to customise aspects of the game, such as difficulty levels, name or player inventory.
- As a user, I want the game to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- As a user, I want visually appealing graphics and designs that enhance the overall gaming experience.

## Game Design

The game's flowchart serves as a visual representation of the player's journey through Eldoria. Starting with the opening screen where players input their name and select a difficulty level, the flowchart branches into three distinct paths â€“ Forest, Town, and Desert. Each path is strategically designed to present unique challenges and encounters, creating a dynamic and varied gameplay experience. There are decisions at critical junctures, representing moments where players must make choices that impact the storyline and their character's health.

Below is a simplified flowchart that illustrates the input validation process in the game. Input validation was crucial to ensure that the player's choices and entries were within the expected parameters, preventing errors and enhancing the overall gaming experience.

## Colour Scheme

As the app was developed for the terminal environment, extensive design elements or colour schemes were not relevant. However, Colorama was utilised strategically to introduce subtle color enhancements to certain aspects of the game. This was done to ensure that crucial information or specific sections of the application (such as green/red for positive/negative events) would stand out and be easily distinguishable for the user within the terminal interface.

## Libraries

### Colorama

I used Colorama as I felt it enhances the user experience. Any addition of colour to the terminal output makes the game more visually appealing appeal and helps users to quickly identify important information.

### Google Sheets API with gspread

Implementing Google Sheets as a data source allowed me to easily modify game elements without changing the code.

### Heroku

A requirement for the project from Code Institute, that made it east to host and share the game online.

### Python libraries

- os: Useful for clearing the terminal screen. This helped to present a clean display, preventing the accumulation of text.
- sys: Within this suite of functions, providing the user with the ability to exit the game was particularly useful.
- time:  Provided time-related functions, such as introducing time delays so all text was visible when needed.
- random: Allowed me to generate random numbers, creating an element of luck within the game.

# Bugs

Aside from regularly documenting smaller bugs through GitHub's commit process, I also used GitHub's issue tracker to monitor and address many of the bugs identified during the development and testing phases of my program. As of now, there are no open bugs, and you can review the historical record of addressed bugs here on GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/NickCMoore/eldoria-text-adventure/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

# Testing

To view the testing file, please click [here](https://github.com/NickCMoore/eldoria-text-adventure/blob/main/TESTING.md).

# Deployment

Code Institute supplied a template for showcasing the terminal view of this backend application in web browser. This enhancement aims to make the project more accessible to a wider audience.

You can access the live deployed application at [Eldoria Text Adventure](https://eldoria-text-adventure-b67c4e715670.herokuapp.com/)

## Local Deployment

VSCode was used to write the code for this project.

To make a local copy of this repository, you can clone the project by typing the follow into your IDE terminal:

git clone https://github.com/nickcmoore/eldoria-text-adventure.git

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

Open in Gitpod

## Heroku Deployment

This project uses Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select Create App.
- From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set the value of KEY to PORT, and the value to 8000 then select add.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select Add Buildpack.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select Python first, then Node.js second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)
- Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
    - requirements.txt
    - Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using: pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

The Procfile can be created with the following command: echo web: node index.js > Procfile

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
- Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a <app_name> (replace app_name with your app, without the angle-brackets)
- After performing the standard Git add, commit, and push to GitHub, you can now type: git push heroku main

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku.
