# **_Eldoria Text Adventure_**

Eldoria Text Adventure is an interactive and mythical journey where the player takes on the role of an adventurer exploring the enchanting realms of Eldoria. This text-based game combines storytelling, puzzle-solving, and decision-making.

Upon entering their name and selecting a difficulty level, players are transported to a crossroads, initiating the game with an element of player choice. Here, they must decide between three distinct paths: Forest, Town, and Desert, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities.

Opting for the Forest Path involves solving the wise old tree's riddle, while exploring the bustling town introduces encounters with shops, mysterious merchants, and engaging puzzles. Navigating the scorching desert presents decisions impacting the character's health and word puzzles to solve.

Players can track their progress with marked completed paths and a visible health score, aiming to achieve the highest possible score. The game concludes with the final score recorded on the leaderboard, providing a competitive element for players to compare their achievements.

## Game Design

The game's flowchart serves as a visual representation of the player's journey through Eldoria. Starting with the opening screen where players input their name and select a difficulty level, the flowchart branches into three distinct paths â€“ Forest, Town, and Desert. Each path is strategically designed to present unique challenges and encounters, creating a dynamic and varied gameplay experience. There are decisions at critical junctures, representing moments where players must make choices that impact the storyline and their character's health.

## Colour Scheme

As the app was developed for the terminal environment, extensive design elements or colour schemes were not relevant. However, Colorama was utilised strategically to introduce subtle color enhancements to certain aspects of the game. This was done to ensure that crucial information or specific sections of the application would stand out and be easily distinguishable for the user within the terminal interface.
